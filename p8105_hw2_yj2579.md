## Problem 1

``` r
# Import and clean the data
trash_data = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
                        sheet = 1, range = "A2:N408")%>%

janitor::clean_names() %>% 
drop_na(dumpster) %>% 

# change 'sports_balls' to integer
mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
)
```

``` r
# import the data of 2017 and change the month from number to English words
Precipitation_2017 = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  mutate(year = "2017", Month = month.name)
  
# import the data of 2018 and change the month from number to English words
Precipitation_2018 = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = 3, range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  mutate(year = "2018", Month = month.name) %>% 
drop_na()

# Combine 2017 data and 2018 data
precipitation_data = as.tibble(rbind(Precipitation_2017, Precipitation_2018 )) 
```

    ## Warning: `as.tibble()` is deprecated, use `as_tibble()` (but mind the new semantics).
    ## This warning is displayed once per session.

``` r
# Alternative way of combining the table
#full_join(
  # Precipitation_2017, Precipitation_2018, by = "Month"
   # ) %>% 
#mutate(precipitation_data, Month = month.name)

trash_data_2017 = filter(trash_data, year == "2017")
```

Mr.trashwell has 344 observations and key variables are weight\_ton,
dumpster and other 12 variables; precipitation of 2017 has 12
observations and 3 variables including month, total, and year;
precipitation of 2018 has 9 observations and same three key variables;
the combination of two years has 19 observations with same three key
variables as well.

The total precipitation in 2018 is 23.5

The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8

# Problem 2

## pol\_month

``` r
# import the data and tidy it
# change month to English words 
# create 'president' variable with value from 'prez-gop' and 'prez-dem'(both are binary)
pol_month = read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>%

         month = month.name[month],
         president = recode(as.character(prez_gop), "1" = "republican", "0" = "democrat"),
         year = as.integer(year)
         ) %>% 
  select(-prez_gop, -prez_dem, -day) 
```

## snp

# import data and change date into month day year
snp = read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate(col = date, into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>% 
mutate(month = as.integer(month)) %>%

## unemployment

``` r

unemployment = read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",

``` r

# then combine the three that we are interested
result_pol_une = full_join(pol_month, unemployment)
```

The dimension of the data set is 828 by 12 after we deleted 3 columns.
The range of years is 1947 to 2015. However, pol\_month data starts from
1947, snp data starts from 1950 and unemployment data starts from 1947.
The names of key variables are listed below with explanation.

For snp data: year: the date of the observation month: the month of the
observation day: the day of the observation close: the closing values of
the S\&P stock index on the associated date

For unemployment data: year: the year of the measurements on that row
month: the month of the measurements on that row each month: percentage
of unemployment in each month of the associated year rate: unemployment
rate mon: date of the count prez\_gop: indicator of whether the
president was republican on the associated date (1 = yes, 0 = no)
gov\_gop: the number of republican governors on the associated date
sen\_gop: the number of republican senators on the associated date
rep\_gop: the number of republican representatives on the associated
date prez\_dem: indicator of whether the president was democratic on the
associated date (1 = yes, 0 = no) gov\_dem: the number of democratic
governors on the associated date sen\_dem: the number of democratic
senators on the associated date rep\_dem: the number of democratic
representatives on the associated date
